import Foundation

// Shared clipboard File Provider domain host (issues #376 guest / #424 host).
//
// Owns the container-app side of the File Provider transport, parameterized by
// a `FileProviderConfig` so the guest agent (host→guest paste) and the
// main app (guest→host "Copy to Mac") share one implementation:
//  1. The XPC relay the sandboxed extension calls on `fetchContents` — the
//     extension can't open vsock, so the owning process (which does) pulls for
//     it.
//  2. Registration of the clipboard File Provider domain so the system
//     instantiates the extension and surfaces the domain in Finder.
//  3. The offer manifest + `signalEnumerator` that declare the current file rep
//     to the system as a dataless placeholder.
//
// Gated on clipboard policy: the domain stands up only once clipboard sharing is
// enabled, so nothing registers a domain in a context that didn't enable
// clipboard (e.g. the CI test host).
//
// Host↔extension IPC uses the canonical `NSFileProviderServicing` anonymous-XPC
// pattern (#460): the domain host injects a `FileProviderServicingConnector`
// that exports the relay to the extension so the extension can call it back at
// `fetchContents`. Both directions share this one connector — the only
// differences come from `FileProviderConfig`. The
// registration/manifest/availability machinery below is direction-agnostic and
// shared as-is.
