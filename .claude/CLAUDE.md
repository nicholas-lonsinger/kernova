# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> Design philosophy and UI guidelines are in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).

## Build & Test

This is an Xcode project (not Swift Package Manager). Inside Xcode, use ⌘B / ⌘U as normal. From the terminal, prefer the `Makefile` wrapper:

```bash
make build               # Build for macOS
make test                # Run the full test suite (all three test targets via Kernova.xctestplan)
make test-suite SUITE=KernovaTests/VMConfigurationTests   # Run a single suite
make test-package        # Run only the KernovaProtocol SwiftPM package tests
make format              # Rewrite Swift sources in place via swift-format
make lint                # Check Swift sources with swift-format --strict
make install-hooks       # One-time: enable .githooks/pre-push (runs `make lint` before push)
make clean               # Remove DerivedData/
```

After cloning, run `make install-hooks` once. This sets `core.hooksPath` to the checked-in `.githooks/` directory so a pre-push hook runs `make lint` locally and matches the swift-format check in `.github/workflows/lint.yml`. Bypass an individual push with `git push --no-verify`.

`make test` is the canonical `xcodebuild` invocation:

```bash
xcodebuild -project Kernova.xcodeproj -scheme Kernova -destination 'platform=macOS' -derivedDataPath DerivedData <build|test>
```

A single `xcodebuild test -scheme Kernova` runs all three test targets (`KernovaTests`, `KernovaGuestAgentTests`, `KernovaProtocolTests`) via `Kernova.xctestplan`. This works because `KernovaProtocol` is referenced as a top-level peer in the project (a `PBXFileReference` in `Kernova.xcodeproj`'s main group) rather than as an `XCLocalSwiftPackageReference` under Package Dependencies. In the dependency form, Xcode treats the package as upstream and hides its `.testTarget`s from the test-plan picker; in the peer form, the package's tests appear in `Edit Scheme → Test → +` as first-class targets and can be added to the test plan. If `KernovaProtocol` ever needs to be re-added, drag the folder into the Project Navigator from Finder rather than using `Add Package Dependencies → Add Local`. `make test-package` exists as a focused shortcut for iterating on package tests in isolation.

The `-derivedDataPath DerivedData` flag ensures build output goes to a deterministic local `DerivedData/` directory (already gitignored) instead of the per-path-hashed `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/` location. This avoids glob ambiguity when worktrees or parallel builds create multiple DerivedData folders. Xcode itself still uses the per-user default — they don't need to share.

### Build version

`CFBundleVersion` is `git rev-list --count HEAD` (the total commit count), substituted into the source `Info.plist` via `INFOPLIST_PREPROCESS`. The `Set Build Number from Git` build phase generates `KernovaBuildNumber.h` with `#define KERNOVA_BUILD_NUMBER N`, and `Kernova/App/Info.plist` references the symbol directly (`<string>KERNOVA_BUILD_NUMBER</string>`). Substitution happens inside `ProcessInfoPlistFile` so build-graph reordering can't clobber it. The `KernovaGuestAgent` target uses the same pattern with its own `AGENT_BUILD_NUMBER` (scoped to `git rev-list --count HEAD -- KernovaGuestAgent/`). When adding a new top-level target that needs a dynamic build number, replicate this pattern instead of patching the built `Info.plist` after the fact.

Requires **macOS 26 (Tahoe)**, **Xcode 26**, **Swift 6**, and **Apple Silicon** (for macOS guest support). The app uses the `com.apple.security.virtualization` entitlement.

## Architecture

> Full directory structure, component map, data flow diagrams, design decisions, and test coverage details are in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). Consult it before making structural changes. The summary below is a quick reference; if it conflicts with ARCHITECTURE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md is authoritative.

Kernova is an AppKit app hosting SwiftUI views that manages virtual machines via Apple's `Virtualization.framework`, supporting macOS and Linux guests.

**Data flow:** `AppDelegate` → `VMLibraryViewModel` → `VMLifecycleCoordinator` → services + SwiftUI views. `MainWindowController` hosts an `NSSplitViewController` with sidebar (`SidebarViewController`, a pure-AppKit source-list `NSOutlineView`) and detail (`DetailContainerViewController`) panes, plus a native `NSToolbar` with `NSToolbarItem`s. The detail pane layers a pure-AppKit `VMDisplayBackingView` (for `VZVirtualMachineView`) over an always-present SwiftUI hosting controller (`MainDetailView` → `VMDetailView`). `VMDirectoryWatcher` monitors the VMs directory for external filesystem changes and triggers reconciliation in the view model.

**Concurrency model:** Everything touching `VZVirtualMachine` is `@MainActor`. The codebase uses Swift 6 strict concurrency. Services that interact with VZ are `@MainActor`-isolated; stateless services are `Sendable` structs. Some VZ delegate callbacks use `nonisolated(unsafe)` with `MainActor.assumeIsolated` to bridge back.

**No third-party dependencies.** The Kernova app target uses only Apple system frameworks. Apple-published Swift Packages (e.g. `apple/swift-protobuf`, currently consumed by the local `KernovaProtocol/` package) are acceptable when they pull their weight; non-Apple packages still require explicit sign-off.

## Development Guidelines

### Unit Tests

When adding new functionality or modifying existing behavior, include unit tests for the changes. Follow the existing patterns in `KernovaTests/`:

- Use Swift Testing (`@Suite`, `@Test`, `#expect`) — not XCTest
- Create mock implementations using protocols (see `KernovaTests/Mocks/`)
- Test models, services, and view models — UI views don't need unit tests
- Test both happy paths and error paths; use error injection in mocks (e.g., setting a `throwError` property)
- Reuse shared test helpers and factories (e.g., `makeInstance()`) rather than duplicating setup logic across test files
- Run the full test suite before committing to ensure nothing is broken

### Logging

The app uses Apple's `os.Logger` (subsystem `com.kernova.app`) with per-component categories. Each service, view model, or model that logs declares a `private static let logger`. When adding or modifying functionality, include log calls at appropriate levels:

| Level | When to use | Persistence |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `.debug` | Method entry with parameter snapshots, intermediate states, per-item iteration results. Diagnostic detail only useful when actively investigating. | Discarded unless streaming via Console.app or `log stream` |
| `.info` | General operational context: routine progress, non-critical outcomes, sub-step completion. | In-memory only; evicted under pressure |
| `.notice` | Definitive lifecycle events: VM started/stopped/paused/resumed/saved, bundle created/deleted, app launch. Events you need for post-mortem analysis. | Persisted to disk |
| `.warning` | Unexpected but recoverable situations: missing files, fallback paths taken, degraded operation. | Persisted to disk |
| `.error` | Failures: operations that did not complete, exceptions caught, error states entered. | Persisted to disk |
| `.fault` | Programming errors: impossible states, compile-time-known inputs that failed lookup. Paired with `assertionFailure`. | Persisted to disk; always visible; never redacted |

**Guidelines:**
- Every new service or view model should declare its own `private static let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.kernova.app", category: "ComponentName")`
- State transitions and irreversible actions (creating/deleting bundles, starting/stopping VMs) should be `.notice`
- Method entry points in complex flows should have `.debug` logs with relevant parameter values
- Do not use `print()`, `NSLog()`, or file-based logging

### Defensive Unwrapping

When calling an API that returns an optional but is invoked with compile-time-known inputs (SF Symbol names, known resource identifiers, hardcoded keys), use `assertionFailure` with a graceful fallback:

```swift
guard let value = knownGoodAPI("compile-time-constant") else {
    logger.fault("Descriptive message '\(context, privacy: .public)'")
    assertionFailure("Descriptive message: \(context)")
    return fallbackValue
}
```

- **Debug builds** crash immediately at the call site, catching typos and deployment-target mismatches on first test run
- **Release builds** return the fallback and log at `.fault` level for post-mortem diagnosis
- Do not force-unwrap (`!`) — it crashes end users. Do not silently return a fallback without `assertionFailure` — it masks bugs during development.

### File Operations

- When deleting files, prefer `trash` over `rm` whenever possible (moves to Trash instead of permanent deletion).

### Review Feedback Handling

When reviewing code — via review tools (`/simplify`, `/review-pr`, etc.), post-implementation review agents, external PR review feedback (bot or human), or while working on adjacent code — every finding must be triaged into one of four categories:

| Category | Action | When to use |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Fix now** | Apply the fix as part of the current work | Valid finding, in scope, reasonable effort |
| **Fix later** | File a GitHub issue (see [Review Debt Tracking](#review-debt-tracking) below) | Valid finding, but out of scope or too large for the current task |
| **Annotate** | Add a `RATIONALE:` comment (see [Intentional Pattern Annotations](#intentional-pattern-annotations)) for human/automated reviewer findings, or a `// periphery:ignore - <reason>` directive (see [Periphery Directives](#periphery-directives)) for dead-code scan false positives | Code looks wrong or unconventional but is correct for a project-specific reason |
| **Dismiss** | No action needed | Pure style nits, cosmetic preferences, trivial improvements with negligible impact |

#### Review Debt Tracking

Valid findings that are **out of scope** for the current task must be captured as GitHub issues rather than silently dropped.

**What to capture** (important + moderate severity):
- Bugs, correctness problems, or logic errors
- Security concerns
- Performance issues
- Meaningful refactoring opportunities or non-trivial code smells
- Missing test coverage for critical paths

**Issue format:**

~~~bash
gh issue create \
  --title "<concise description of the finding>" \
  --label "<review-debt/label>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Found during
<PR #N / review of `FileName.swift` / context description>

## Description
<What the issue is and why it matters>

## Location
<File path(s) and line number(s) or function name(s)>

## Suggested fix
<Brief suggestion if one is obvious, otherwise omit this section>
EOF
)"
~~~

**Labels** — use the most specific match:

| Label | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `review-debt/bug` | Correctness issues, logic errors, potential crashes |
| `review-debt/security` | Security concerns, unsafe patterns |
| `review-debt/performance` | Inefficient code paths, unnecessary allocations |
| `review-debt/refactor` | Code smells, duplication, poor abstractions |
| `review-debt/test-gap` | Missing or insufficient tests for critical code |

**Guidelines:**
- **File issues immediately** — do not list qualifying findings as "skipped" and wait for the user to ask. If a finding meets the severity criteria above, create the issue as part of the review flow before summarizing results.
- Always check for existing issues before creating duplicates
- Reference the source PR or file context in the issue body
- Keep issue titles actionable and specific (e.g., "Add error handling for disk-full scenario in BundleManager" not "Improve error handling")
- When multiple related findings exist, group them into a single issue if they share a root cause
- After creating issues, mention them in the conversation so the user is aware

#### Intentional Pattern Annotations

When a review flags code that *looks* wrong or unconventional but is **intentionally correct** for a project-specific reason, add an inline comment with the `RATIONALE:` prefix explaining why. This prevents the same pattern from being re-flagged in future reviews.

**When to annotate:**
- The code contradicts a general best practice but is correct here due to framework constraints, performance requirements, or architectural decisions
- A reviewer (human or automated) would reasonably flag this without project-specific context
- The reason is not already documented in CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, or an adjacent comment

**Format:**

```swift
// RATIONALE: VZVirtualMachine delegates are not actor-isolated by the framework,
// so we use nonisolated(unsafe) and bridge back via MainActor.assumeIsolated.
nonisolated(unsafe) func guestDidStop(_ virtualMachine: VZVirtualMachine) {
```

**Guidelines:**
- Keep annotations concise — explain *why* the pattern is correct, not *what* the code does
- If the same rationale applies project-wide (not just at one call site), consider adding it to CLAUDE.md or ARCHITECTURE.md instead of repeating the comment on every instance
- `RATIONALE:` comments are greppable — use `grep -r "RATIONALE:"` to audit all intentional deviations
- Do not use `RATIONALE:` for general explanatory comments — reserve it strictly for patterns that would otherwise be flagged as issues

#### Periphery Directives

When the dead-code scan flags a symbol that is alive through machinery Periphery's symbol graph cannot see — protocol witnesses invoked by Swift's compiler-emitted code (string interpolation, `Codable`), members reached through type inference on argument labels, declarations referenced only from a test target Periphery does not currently scan, or symbols intentionally retained for API symmetry — annotate the declaration with `// periphery:ignore - <reason>` instead of deleting it. This is the Periphery-specific counterpart to `RATIONALE:`: same spirit (silence a finding that would otherwise be re-raised every scan), different syntax that the tool itself recognizes.

**When to annotate vs. fix vs. dismiss:**
- **Annotate** when the symbol is genuinely used through one of the invisible paths above, OR when the surface is intentionally complete (e.g. all `os.Logger` levels exposed even if a particular call isn't used today).
- **Fix** when the finding is real — delete the symbol, or demote `public` to `internal` if only the access level is redundant.
- **Dismiss** does not apply: every annotation must include a reason, since silently retained symbols become a maintenance hazard.

**Format:**

```swift
/// `true` when no buffered bytes remain.
// periphery:ignore - Used by `VsockFrameTests` via `@testable import`,
// which Periphery's scheme-based scan doesn't currently index for the
// SwiftPM package test target.
var isEmpty: Bool { buffer.count == readOffset }
```

Place the directive **between** the doc comment (`///`) and the declaration so DocC still associates the doc with the symbol.

**Guidelines:**
- Keep the rationale on the same comment block as the directive — multi-line if needed, but no blank line between `// periphery:ignore` and the reason text
- Greppable via `grep -r "periphery:ignore"` for periodic auditing — when the underlying machinery becomes visible to Periphery (e.g. a scan-coverage gap is closed), revisit the annotations and remove any that are no longer needed
- Prefer per-symbol annotations over re-toggling broad config flags like `retain_public` — see `.periphery.yml` for the project-level guidance

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming

Before starting work in a worktree, create a descriptively-named branch. Use the format `<type>/<short-description>`, where `<type>` matches the commit type prefixes (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`):

```
feat/vm-snapshot-support
fix/display-sizing-on-switch
refactor/extract-lifecycle-coordinator
```

Create and switch to the branch before making any changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/vm-snapshot-support
```

Keep descriptions concise (2-4 words, kebab-case). The branch name should make the PR's purpose clear at a glance.

### Commit Messages

These conventions apply to **all** forms of committing: local commits, PR squash/merge commits, and any other git operations that produce commits.

Use the following format for all commits:

```
<type>: <concise subject line>

## Summary
- <user-facing intent: what capability was added/fixed/changed and why>

## Changes
- <implementation details: specific files, types, or components modified>

## Test plan
- [ ] <verification step as a checkbox>
```

A `## Notes` section may be added optionally if there are caveats, follow-ups, or things reviewers should know.

### Type prefixes

| Prefix     | Usage                                      |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `feat`     | New feature or capability                  |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                    |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring with no behavior change |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                         |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                   |
| `chore`    | Build, CI, tooling, or dependency updates  |
| `style`    | Formatting, whitespace, or cosmetic changes|

### Example

```
feat: Add VM snapshot support

## Summary
- Add the ability to take and restore snapshots of running virtual machines
- Enables users to save and revert VM state at any point

## Changes
- Add SnapshotService with create/restore/delete operations
- Add snapshot UI to VMDetailView toolbar
- Persist snapshot metadata in VMConfiguration

## Test plan
- [ ] Built successfully on macOS 26
- [ ] Tested snapshot create/restore cycle with macOS and Linux guests
- [ ] All existing tests pass
```

### Scoping the message

Commit messages must reflect the full intent and scope of all changes, not just the last operation performed. Before writing a commit message, review both the conversation context (what the user asked for, the steps taken) and the staged diff holistically. Lead with the primary purpose; secondary details (naming conventions, formatting choices) belong in the body.

The `Co-Authored-By` trailer is automatically appended by Claude Code and should not be duplicated in the commit message body.

### Merging Pull Requests

When merging PRs with `gh pr merge`, always squash-merge with `--squash --subject` using the PR title and appending the PR number in parentheses (e.g., `--squash --subject "fix: Title (#11)"`), matching the repo's existing convention.

**Do not use `--delete-branch`.** The repo has `delete_branch_on_merge` enabled on GitHub, so remote branches are auto-deleted. The `--delete-branch` flag causes `gh` to run `git checkout main` locally, which fails in worktree contexts.

**Linking issues for auto-close:** When a PR resolves GitHub issues, include `Closes #N` (or `Fixes #N`) in the PR body — not just a table reference like `| #N |`. GitHub only auto-closes issues when the merge commit or PR body contains the exact keywords `closes`, `fixes`, or `resolves` followed by `#N`. Place them in the summary section or as a standalone line (e.g., `Closes #12, #34, #56`).

#### Post-merge cleanup

After a successful merge, run the following steps to clean up the local branch and sync:

1. `gh pr view <N> --json state -q .state` — confirm `"MERGED"` before deleting anything
2. If in a worktree: switch to the worktree's local branch, which is always the worktree name with a `worktree-` prefix (e.g., `git checkout worktree-expressive-yawning-sutton` for a worktree named `expressive-yawning-sutton`)
3. `git branch -D <merged-branch>`
4. `git branch -d -r origin/<merged-branch>`
5. `git pull`

### Post-Commit

After a commit/push, if any new preferences or insights emerged during the work, ask the user if they'd like to add them to memory.

## Architecture Change Protocol

After completing any task that hits one or more of the following triggers, suggest follow-up updates before considering the task complete.

### Triggers
- Added, removed, renamed, or moved a file or directory
- Changed how components communicate (new API surface, changed data flow, new service)
- Added or removed a dependency or framework
- Changed build configuration, entitlements, or tooling
- Created a new public type/protocol or significantly changed an existing one
- Changed the concurrency model or actor isolation of a component

### Required Follow-ups

1. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** — Read the relevant sections first, then propose specific, targeted updates to reflect the change. Update the directory structure, component map, design decisions, or test coverage sections as needed. Do not rewrite the entire file — make surgical edits.

2. **Testing** — For any new public function, type, or component:
   - Write tests following the patterns in KernovaTests/ (Swift Testing, mocks, factories)
   - If tests are deferred, explicitly state what's needed and why it was skipped

3. **CLAUDE.md** — Update only if build commands, the concurrency model summary, or the data flow summary changed. Preserve commit message format and development guidelines as-is.

4. **Maintenance Notes** — At the end of your response, include a summary:

   ### Maintenance Notes
   - ✅ Updated ARCHITECTURE.md directory structure
   - ✅ Added tests for NewComponent
   - ⚠️ No tests yet for `newFunction()` — needs mock for ExternalDependency
   - ✅ CLAUDE.md unchanged (no structural impact)
